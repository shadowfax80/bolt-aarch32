# Correctness fixes

## A32 literal loads (2026-09-30)

The upstream 0008 and ATFE 0014 overlays correct backward literal-load
offsets, subtract-zero decoding, and symbolic MC operands. JITLink now handles
R_ARM_LDR_PC_G0 with signed imm12 range checks while preserving predicate and
register bits. Regression tests cover forward/backward loads, nonzero addends,
ordinary register-based loads, and positive/negative range boundaries.

Validation on the ATFE assertions-enabled Release build:

- BOLT ARM suite passed (13/13 before the separate unwind change).
- LLVM JITLink AArch32 suite passed (13/13).
- Full LK image emission passed, replacing the previous unsupported-fixup errors.
- Postprocessed QEMU image completed four workloads. Postprocessing restores
  original sections, so this does not prove that every rewritten function ran.

The upstream overlay applied cleanly to its pinned base plus patches 0001-0007;
the upstream build has not been tested. The Pi passed baseline serial/upload,
checksum, and benchmark sanity checks, but the modified BOLT output has not yet
been verified on hardware. These fixes do not close the full relocation audit.

## EHABI rejection boundary

The upstream 0009 and ATFE 0015 overlays reject nonempty `.ARM.extab`,
malformed exidx record lengths, and exidx descriptors other than CANTUNWIND.
Genuine EHABI unwinding needs index relocation and sorting before it can be
supported safely. The rejection regression passed on ATFE; the complete BOLT
ARM suite passed 14/14 and JITLink AArch32 passed 13/13. Full LK emission passed.
The upstream overlay applied cleanly but has not been build-tested.

## Pi verification and failure propagation (2026-10-01)

Using the modified ATFE build, stair edge instrumentation ran on the Pi and
returned a complete checksum-verified 85,165-byte counter dump. That hardware
profile produced an ext-tsp optimized image and a no-reordering control image.
The original entry was redirected into the emitted stair function, moving it
from 0x80008e0a to 0x80061000. The original and both rewritten variants completed
two runs each on the Pi; all six checksums were 0x5b19056f. This verifies this
Thumb workload and pipeline, not every A32 literal-load case or full-image
rewrite. No speed claim is made from this small correctness sample.

`verify-all-wsl.sh` now returns failure if any child gate fails while continuing
to run later gates. `pi4_compare.py` returns failure for mismatched or missing
workload checksums instead of printing an error and returning success.
Run `python3 scripts/tests/check-verification-failures.py` under Linux/WSL to
check all-pass, failed-child, later-gate execution, and checksum failure paths
without requiring hardware. Real serial observations are mocked for this
failure-path test; hardware verification above used the actual Pi.
